title: "Running rakaia from a standalone executable"

The rakaia executable (usually) requires the use of a terminal window to communicate with the underlying server.

Once the zip bundle is downloaded and unzipped, there should be a single file named
`rakaia_{os}_{version}` in the unzipped destination.

## Windows

On Windows, the executable can simply be opened by double-clicking the application icon. In some cases, it may require admin permissions. For this, right-click the application and select `Run as administrator`

## macOS

For macOS, right-click the executable file and select `Open with` -> `Other`. Select `Enable` -> `All Applications`,
then navigate to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`. Run the application by double-clicking.

\
**NOTE**: macOS users should first disable `Airplay Receiver` in `Settings`
before executing the binary, as the receiver feature uses the same port
as Rakaia's default.
\

**NOTE**: On macOS, it is possible that the rakaia executable will be
flagged due to security reasons. If the application fails to start, users
should check the security settings to see if rakaia is flagged from an unknown developer:
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac.
If so, users should enable the software to be installed, then try opening the file again.

## Linux

On Linux, the application can be double-clicked or run through the command line:

```
./rakaia_linux-x86_64_{version}
```

Opening the application should trigger a new Terminal window. On first run, it may take a while as the application parses through all dependencies and verifies the bundled interpreter.


**NOTE**: Double clicking the application on Linux will run it in the background without a terminal,
and the port usage will need to be killed with fuser or kill.
It is recommended to execute on Linux through the command line.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows SDK dependencies

In certain cases, Windows user may need to install the [Windows Development SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) to have all required dll libraries for rakaia on windows.
